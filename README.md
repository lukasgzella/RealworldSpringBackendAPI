# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> This Java/Spring codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with Java 17, SpringBoot 3.1.1, Spring Security 6, Hibernate, including CRUD operations, JWT authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

At actual state of development this api works on local server with H2 database. It can handle requests from any frontend from this codebase: https://codebase.show/projects/realworld

# In progress

I am currently working on deployment this backend API along with Angular frontend on AWS instance EC2.
